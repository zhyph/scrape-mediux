    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config # REQUIRED
      - /path/to/config/cache:/app/out # RECOMMENDED, if you don't bind this, the cache will be stored in the container and can easily be lost
      - /path/to/config/profile:/profile # RECOMMENDED, must match profile_path in config.json, if you don't bind this, the profile can be removed and you will need to login again (which is not a big deal, but it will take longer)
      - /path/to/kometa/metadata:/out # OPTIONAL, output_dir in config.json (or args) must match this
